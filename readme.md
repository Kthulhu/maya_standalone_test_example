## About

This is sample code for compiling standalone applications linked to the Maya
libraries. It includes a sample Maya scene file reader application and the
corresponding CMake configuration files, along with a second applcation that 
demonstrates how to run unit tests using the [Catch](http://github.com/philsquared/Catch) 
framework.


## Usage

Run the binaries in ``bin`` with the ``--help`` option to see how to use them. 

The first program is an application that will print the name of all mesh shapes
within the given maya files.

The second program is an application that runs a sample unit test.


## Building

### Requirements

* Maya 2016 (and above) needs to be installed in order to link to the libraries. 
* You will also need the devkit headers, which are available from the official 
  Autodesk Github repository.
* CMake 2.8.11 and higher is required for building.

### Instructions for building with CMake

* Create a ``build`` directory and navigate to it. 
* Run ``cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`` and then ``cmake --build .
  --config Release --target install``. The binaries should be installed in the
  ``bin`` folder.
